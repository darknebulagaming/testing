# Testing
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.4.

# Purpose
The purpose of this page is to test out Angular modules and HTML/CSS/Javascript techniques, as well as show off some of my skills as a web developer.

# Functionality
Currently you can hit login for some snackbar action (try it 3 times for a surprise!)
Use the password 'admin' to see a preview of the blog-like page.
Hit the watermark in the lower-left hand corner to jump back to the landing page (its hidden, but it'll appear when you need it)
